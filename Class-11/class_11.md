---

## 1. Recap of Last Week
- Control and loop statements
- Linear algebra in NumPy
- Data inspection
- Importance of Requirement Analysis
- Case studies on requirement analysis
- Linear/Multi-Linear Regression, SVM, Cost Function

---

## 2. Today’s Focus
- Introduction to **Gitflow** version control
- Differences between **Agile** and **Waterfall** in Japan
- Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) and **Clean Architecture**
- Quiz and Q&A

---

## 3. Version Control & Git
- **Definition**: Tracks file changes over time, aids collaboration
- **Types**: Centralized (e.g., SVN) vs. Distributed (e.g., Git)
- **Git Features**: Distributed, branching, fast, secure
- **Basic Commands**: `git init`, `git clone`, `git commit`, `git push/pull`, `git branch/merge`

---

## 4. Gitflow Workflow
A structured branching model for Git:
- **Branches**: 
  - `Master`: Production-ready
  - `Develop`: Integration
  - `Feature`: New features
  - `Release`: Pre-production
  - `Hotfix`: Bug fixes
- **Steps**: Create feature → Merge to develop → Release → Master
- **Pros**: Organized, scalable  
- **Cons**: Complex for small teams
- **Task 1**: Gitflow Adventure (click buttons in order)

---

## 5. Agile vs. Waterfall
- **Agile**: Iterative, flexible, customer-focused
  - Principles: Collaboration, adaptability, working software
  - Frameworks: Scrum, Kanban, SAFe
- **Waterfall**: Linear, sequential
  - Phases: Requirements → Design → Coding → Testing → Deployment → Maintenance
  - Pros: Structured, documented  
  - Cons: Inflexible, long cycles
- **In Japan**: Waterfall for traditional firms, Agile for startups

---

## 6. Agile vs. Waterfall in Japan
- **Trends**: Waterfall in legacy companies, Agile in modern IT
- **Culture**: Kaizen suits Agile, risk avoidance favors Waterfall
- **Case Studies**:
  - Agile: Tokyo startup, 30% faster releases
  - Waterfall: Automotive ERP, stable but delayed

---

## 7. Clean Architecture
Separates concerns for maintainability:
- **Layers**: 
  - Entities (business rules)
  - Use Cases (app logic)
  - Interface Adapters (controllers)
  - Frameworks & Drivers (UI/DB)
- **Benefits**: Testable, scalable, framework-independent
- **In SDLC**: Fits design, testing, maintenance phases

---

## 8. Interactive Task
- **Task 2**: Agile, Waterfall, Lean-Agile Adventure
