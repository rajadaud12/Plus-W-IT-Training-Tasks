### Acknowledgement
- Supported by **AOTS** and **OEC**
- **Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry**
- **Overseas Employment Corporation**

---

## 1. Recap of Last Week
- Control and loop statements
- Linear algebra in NumPy
- Data inspection and requirement analysis
- Machine learning algorithms (Linear Regression, SVM)
- SDLC, Gitflow, Agile, and Waterfall methodologies

---

## 2. Todayâ€™s Focus
- Importance of IT security in business
- Types of security and security mindset
- Security compliance: Standards, frameworks, and processes
- Case studies on compliance failures

---

## 3. IT Security & Its Importance
- **Definition**: Protects systems, data, and operations from threats
- **Why It Matters**:
  - Safeguards sensitive information
  - Ensures business continuity
  - Maintains customer trust
  - Meets legal/regulatory requirements
- **Example**: Banks use encryption and firewalls to prevent data breaches

---

## 4. Types of Security
- **Physical**: Restricts access (e.g., biometric scanners)
- **Application**: Secures apps (e.g., input validation for SQL injection)
- **Cloud**: Protects cloud services (e.g., AWS IAM role-based access)
- **Network**: Secures data in transit (e.g., firewalls, IDS)
- **Data**: Protects stored/transmitted data (e.g., encryption)
- **Operational**: Policies/procedures (e.g., access logging)

---

## 5. Security Mindset
- **Red Team vs. Blue Team**:
  - Red: Simulates attacks to find vulnerabilities
  - Blue: Defends systems
  - Example: Penetration testing to strengthen defenses
- **Least Privilege**: Minimum access needed (e.g., cashier accesses billing, not HR)

---

## 6. Common Threats
- **Social Engineering**: Manipulating users (e.g., fake IT support calls)
- **Phishing**: Fake emails/sites (e.g., fraudulent bank login pages)
- **Malware/Ransomware**: Damages/locks systems (e.g., WannaCry)
- **Misconfigurations**: Exposed systems (e.g., public cloud buckets)

---

## 7. Security Compliance
- **Definition**: Adherence to standards/regulations for data/system security
- **Purpose**:
  - Protect data
  - Prevent breaches
  - Meet legal/industry obligations
  - Build trust
- **Examples**:
  - HIPAA: Encrypting patient data
  - GDPR: Transparent data processing

---

## 8. Compliance Frameworks & Controls
- **Frameworks**:
  - ISO/IEC 27001, 27017, 27018
  - NIST, GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS, SOC 2
- **Controls**:
  - Administrative: Policies, training
  - Technical: Firewalls, MFA, encryption
  - Physical: Biometrics, CCTV
- **Example**: PCI DSS for secure payment gateways

---

## 9. Compliance Process
1. Risk Assessment
2. Define Security Policies
3. Implement Controls
4. Regular Audits/Reviews
5. Documentation/Reporting
- **Tools**: AWS/Azure Compliance Centers, Nessus, Qualys

---

## 10. Why Compliance Matters
- **Business Value**: Protects data, avoids fines, maintains reputation
- **Legal Mandates**: GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS compliance
- **Operational Benefits**: Resilient systems, early breach detection
- **Example**: SOC 2 compliance helps SaaS companies win Fortune 500 clients

---

## 11. Case Studies
- **Equifax (2017)**: Unpatched vulnerability, $575M fine
  - Lesson: Prioritize patch management
- **Capital One (2019)**: AWS S3 misconfiguration, $80M fine
  - Lesson: Strong IAM and WAFs critical
- **HIPAA Violation**: Unencrypted devices, $3M fine
  - Lesson: Encrypt data, maintain audit logs
