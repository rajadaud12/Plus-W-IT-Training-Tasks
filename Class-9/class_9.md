## 3. Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
The **SDLC** is a structured process used to design, develop, test, and deploy software applications.

### Phases of SDLC
1. **Requirement Analysis**
   - Gather business and technical requirements
   - Identify stakeholders and project scope
2. **Planning**
   - Define project timeline, cost estimation, and resource allocation
   - Identify risks and mitigation strategies
3. **Design**
   - Create architectural and UI/UX designs
   - Define database structures and system components
4. **Development (Implementation)**
   - Code the software based on design specifications
   - Follow best practices and use version control
5. **Testing**
   - Perform unit, integration, and system testing
   - Identify and fix bugs
6. **Deployment**
   - Release software to production
   - Implement CI/CD pipelines
7. **Maintenance & Support**
   - Monitor performance, fix bugs, and update features

## 4. Requirement Analysis: The Foundation of SDLC
Requirement Analysis is the **first and most crucial phase** of the SDLC. It involves gathering, analyzing, and defining stakeholder needs to ensure the software meets business objectives.

### Key Components
1. **Gather Business and Technical Requirements**
   - **Business Requirements**
     - Identify the software’s purpose
     - Understand business goals and objectives
     - Define expected features and functionalities
   - **Technical Requirements**
     - Determine technology stack (e.g., languages, databases, frameworks)
     - Define performance, scalability, and security needs
     - Identify integration requirements with existing systems

2. **Identify Stakeholders and Project Scope**
   - **Stakeholders**
     - Clients/Customers (end users)
     - Business Analysts (translate needs to requirements)
     - Project Managers (oversee timeline and budget)
     - Developers & Architects (build the system)
     - Testers (ensure functionality)
   - **Project Scope**
     - Define included/excluded features
     - Specify supported platforms (web, mobile, desktop)
     - Outline constraints (budget, timeline, compliance)

3. **Outcomes of Requirement Analysis**
   - **Software Requirement Specification (SRS) Document**
     - Details functional and non-functional requirements
   - **Use Cases & User Stories**
     - Describe user interactions with the system
   - **Wireframes & Prototypes**
     - Visual representations of the UI

## 5. Why Requirement Analysis Matters
Poor requirement analysis is a common root cause of project or sprint failures.

### Consequences of Poor Requirement Analysis
- Project and sprint schedule delays
- Increased developer workload and overtime
- Misaligned software with business goals

## 6. Case Studies
### Case Study 1: Notification Requirement Gap
- **Timeline**: Project started in September 2024, delivery planned for October 2025
- **Issue**: During testing, a notification defect was found
- **Development Team**: Assumed notifications were only for the web app
- **Product Owner (PO)**: Expected notifications via webhook to other systems
- **Root Cause**: Lack of in-depth backlog analysis
- **Key Learnings**:
  - Clarify requirements with stakeholders early
  - Analyze product backlog thoroughly
  - Maintain clear communication with the PO
  - Identify integration points upfront

### Case Study 2: Missing Backend System in Product Backlog
- **Issue**: PO focused only on user-facing system, omitting backend (e.g., CMS)
- **Impact**: Late discovery led to overtime and redesign
- **Root Cause**: PO’s lack of technical knowledge
- **Key Learnings**:
  - Collaborate with PO to include technical requirements
  - Validate requirements before development
  - Document frontend and backend needs

### Case Study 3: Missing Error Case Handling
- **Issue**: Development focused only on normal use cases, neglecting error handling
- **Impact**: Delayed sprints and project timeline
- **Root Cause**: Incomplete backlog review
- **Key Learnings**:
  - Analyze normal and error cases
  - Test edge cases during sprints
  - Plan for error handling in advance

---

## 7. Summary of Requirement Analysis
- Developers must understand:
  - Business goals and domain knowledge
  - Project overview (goals, purpose, schedule)
  - User needs and product backlog details
- **Note**: Don’t fully trust the PO’s documentation—verify and question gaps (e.g., error cases, non-functional requirements).
